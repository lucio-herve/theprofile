<h1>Hello, I'm Lucio :)</i></h1>

<p>

I love cinema, since I am a child, and music, more precisely US rap. I also am passionate about sneakers, I collect them, and I follow the actuality and tendance of the new industry very closely on the site StockX.

<h2>Cinema </h2>

<p>

My family and I are very fond of movies, we collect them at home. I go to the cinema at least once a week and I like to analyse them and talk about my impressions about them afterwards.

<h2>Music </h2>

<p>

I am fond of music, it allows me to escape in my own world. I mainly listen to US rap, it gives my goosebumps

<h2>Sneakers </h2>

<p>

The industry of sneakers has risen in the last few years, it is a growing market that fascinates me. The pairs are all different from each other allowing for a variety of styles. some are hard to get and it's this taste for rarity and exclusivity that I research and like.
